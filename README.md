# sklearn_toy_datasets_analyzes
My interpretation of datasets included in the Scikit-learn package

As of March 2022 I am new to data science and machine learning. To help practice I decided to analyze and create machine learning estimators (models) for public datasets.
For ease of use and documentation support, I decided to use the toy datasets included in the Scikit-learn packages.

The documentation for these toy datasets can be found at: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html
